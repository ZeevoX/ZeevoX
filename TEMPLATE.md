### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student from London studying chemistry and computer science! I love open sourcing my code. You can track my progress in [learning C#](https://github.com/ZeevoX/Elasmobranch) or head on over to [my website](https://zeevox.net). 

_Having been on GitHub for **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years, I've opened **{{ ISSUES }}** issues and submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests, and in total I've made **{{ COMMITS }}** commits across the {{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }} repositories that I have contributed to._
